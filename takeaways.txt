Key Takeaways

1. For SPI we first configure the spi bus, then register the spi device and then send data on the bus.
2. For UART we first initialize the uart (0~MAX_UART - 1), then configure the UART, then configure the pins (RX, TX, CTS, RTS) where RTS and CTS are optional. Used UART 0 which is used for serial monitor debugging (as I did not have the dongle)
3. For JTAG debugging need WROOMER (or any model with builtin JTAG) or a JTAG adapter device.
4. internal and external linkage and multiple definition error. I.e in the header file I used `vartype varname` which is definiation as it gives varname a garbage value. For decleration use `extern vartype varname`. Functions are extern by default. Internal linkage is done via using the static keyword.
